I aimed to build a simple but functional pipeline for generating 3D models from either a photo or a text prompt. For text-to-3D, I used OpenAIâ€™s SHAP-E model due to its open-source availability and dual-mode support. For photo input, I included background removal (rembg) to isolate the main object before generating the model. The output is saved in .obj format for compatibility with viewers and printers, and I added a basic 3D visualization to help users preview results without extra tools.
